Project Description: Smart Doorbell for Hearing-Impaired Individuals Using FPGA and Digital Signal Processing
The Smart Doorbell for Hearing-Impaired Individuals is an innovative project designed to enhance accessibility for individuals with hearing impairments. Leveraging the capabilities of an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) and Digital Signal Processing (DSP) techniques, the doorbell provides tactile and visual feedback to effectively alert the user of a visitor's presence.

System Overview:
The system integrates various sensors and output modules to ensure seamless operation:

Input Sensors: A push button, knock sensor, microphone, vibration sensor, light sensor, and camera module.

Output Devices: A consolidated LED for visual alerts, a vibration motor for tactile feedback, and an optional wireless signal for remote notification.

Core Features:
Efficient Signal Processing:
Digital Signal Processing is implemented for filtering and analyzing inputs from the knock sensor and microphone. This ensures precise detection of genuine signals while minimizing false triggers.

Adaptive Feedback Mechanism:

When the doorbell button is pressed, LEDs provide an immediate visual alert while the vibration motor generates tactile feedback.

The vibration motor is programmed to stay active slightly longer to ensure the alert is noticeable.

Live Camera Feed:
The camera module continuously streams video of the visitor without alerting the user, enabling discreet monitoring.

Integrated Fault Detection:
The system includes fault detection to identify and signal malfunctions in sensors or output devices, ensuring reliable operation.

Scalable Design:
The design can be extended to include additional sensors or outputs as required, making it adaptable for future enhancements.

Technical Implementation:
The FPGA is programmed using Verilog and supports real-time data processing. Key design components include:

DSP Algorithms: Implemented for filtering and noise reduction in microphone and knock sensor signals.

Finite State Machines (FSMs): Used for efficient task scheduling and control logic.

Timing Analysis: Ensures synchronization between inputs and outputs for precise operation.

Significance:
This project exemplifies the application of modern digital technologies to address societal challenges. It ensures that hearing-impaired individuals can interact with their environment more effectively, promoting inclusivity and independence.

Applications:
Residential doorbell systems for hearing-impaired individuals.

Use in environments where silent alerts are preferred, such as libraries or hospitals.

Security systems with integrated DSP-based signal analysis.

This project represents a practical and impactful solution, demonstrating the versatility of FPGA and DSP technologies in real-world applications.
